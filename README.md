# Note.io -MERN Note-taking App

## Overview

The MERN Note-taking App is a full-stack web application designed to streamline note management. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it provides a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, deleting, and viewing notes. The application incorporates user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure account creation and note storage.
